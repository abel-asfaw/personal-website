                As a Software Developer on the Selling and Listing Experience
                (SALE) and Concierge engineering teams, I played a key role in
                enhancing the agent-facing search filters, which led to a 30%
                increase in positive user feedback. In addition to developing
                email templates for the Concierge notification system, I
                actively collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure
                seamless project execution. I also documented Conductor
                workflows, significantly increasing team productivity. By
                interviewing team members, I identified and addressed core
                issues, improving overall engineering processes.

                assignment creation. I received positive feedback from 90% of
                students and consistently improved my teaching methods based on
                their input. My expertise in teaching complex coding concepts
                was crucial in helping students of varying skill levels succeed.

                introductory computer science courses focusing on Python
                programming fundamentals and OOP principles in C++. I worked
                with 1 to 4 students per session, fostering strong relationships
                that created a positive and supportive learning environment. My
                dedication, effectiveness, and supportive approach earned praise
                from faculty members, who acknowledged my commitment to helping
                students understand complex programming concepts and techniques.

                During my internship at Northrop Grumman, I automated build and
                deployment processes for large-scale ground system solutions in
                an agile environment. By using Ansible, I reduced the Minio
                deployment process time from 2 hours to just 6 minutes and saved
                9 minutes daily on the privilege escalation process for testers
                and developers. I also coached fellow interns on Ansible
                adoption, further promoting its use within the organization.
